    "title": "Private Grief in a Public World",
    "description": "Grief, while deeply personal, often becomes a public performance due to societal expectations. This article examines the conflict between private mourning and social pressure for visible grieving, drawing from both the author's experience of losing her father to esophageal cancer and scholarly research, particularly Judith Butler's work on performativity. The analysis contrasts anticipatory grief—an internal, unrecognized experience—with the prescribed rituals of public mourning across various cultures, from Islamic and Hindu traditions to Western practices. These social expectations frequently overshadow the complex, individual nature of loss. This piece advocates for recognizing grief as a unique, personal journey that needs no audience or social validation, challenging readers to respect the private nature of mourning and support healing without judgment.",
