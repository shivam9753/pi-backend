    "title": "Private Grief in a Public World",
    "body": "<i>Grief, while deeply personal, often becomes a public performance due to societal expectations. This article examines the conflict between private mourning and social pressure for visible grieving, drawing from both the author's experience of losing her father to esophageal cancer and scholarly research, particularly Judith Butler's work on performativity. The analysis contrasts anticipatory grief—an internal, unrecognized experience—with the prescribed rituals of public mourning across various cultures, from Islamic and Hindu traditions to Western practices. These social expectations frequently overshadow the complex, individual nature of loss. This piece advocates for recognizing grief as a unique, personal journey that needs no audience or social validation, challenging readers to respect the private nature of mourning and support healing without judgment.</i><div><br><div></div><div></div><div><b>Trigger Warning: Mention of Death\r</b></div><div><br></div><div>When my father passed away, grief arrived with quiet intensity, yet society demanded it be loud and visible. My mother and I had already endured months of watching him suffer from esophageal cancer, seeing him fade day by day, and feeling our hearts break in silence. We grieved then, privately, in those final two months as his life slipped away. But after his death, people expected a different kind of grief from us—a public display, a recognizable performance of sorrow. The quiet pain we carried, the exhaustion, the helplessness—none of it seemed enough.\r</div><div>The intimate, raw grief felt in private stands in stark contrast to the scripted sorrow society expects to witness. Is there a \"correct\" way to grieve, a way that looks suitably broken to others? Through personal experience and scholarly reflection, the tension emerges between our authentic mourning and the performative displays expected by those around us, raising the question of whether grief can ever truly belong to us if we're pressured to perform it.\r</div><div><br></div><div>Grief began for us long before my father passed away. It came quietly and without warning in the hospital room where he learned about his illness. This started a long, tough journey that changed how my mother and I felt about loss. Those final two months were like standing on a cliff edge, looking into a darkness we couldn’t pull him back from. His body was there, but we saw his spirit—his vitality, his laughter, his hope—begin to dissolve in front of us. We were mourning the loss of a father, a husband, a man who had been everything to us, not at the moment of his death but each day as his body weakened, as his voice softened, as he seemed to fade into a space where we couldn’t follow.\r</div><div><br></div><div>This experience was far from the conventional image of grief society expects to see. Our sorrow didn’t wait for funeral rites or condolences to set in; it rooted itself in each visit to the hospital, each quiet drive home, and each night spent watching him fight through pain, bravely and helplessly. Grief, at that time, was not just sorrow; it was the daily torment of witnessing his suffering and our inability to change it. We weren’t performing anything, and there was no visible display. Our pain wasn't shown through sad clothes or crying faces; it was felt in our quiet hands, the looks we gave each other when words weren't enough, and the deep sadness of knowing he was slowly leaving us.\r</div><div><br></div><div>Anticipatory grief, as it is sometimes called, often lacks a framework in our cultural understanding of loss, which tends to focus on what happens after death. Yet this private, anticipatory grief was more vivid, more piercing, and more consuming than anything we would feel in the days that followed his passing. It’s a peculiar kind of heartbreak, knowing that each visit might be the last time you’ll hear his voice or hold his hand, feeling grateful for every moment and simultaneously terrified that the next might be the last.\r</div><div><br></div><div>What defined this period was not just sorrow but helplessness—a sense of suspended reality where our lives were woven around his suffering, leaving no room for anything else. The act of supporting him, of sitting with him in his pain, brought an intimacy to our grief that is almost indescribable. It’s a part of mourning that happens behind closed doors, invisible to the outside world, without the comforting rituals of funeral rites or the consoling words of friends and family. There is no validation in this quiet mourning, no room for explanation, and certainly no need to share it. It’s a private sorrow, shared in silence, in the very presence of the person whose absence you’re dreading.\r</div><div>***\r</div><div>When he passed, the shock of it was, in a way, softened by the fact that we had already been grieving. The grief didn’t start on that day; it merely shifted form. This early grief was raw and complex, making it difficult to face the expectations others had for how we should grieve outwardly after his death. In those two months, we mourned deeply, in ways words cannot capture and in ways society would never see. The reality of this private sorrow set it apart from anything we could have performed; it was as real as it was invisible. In those last months, we discovered that real grief happens away from others' eyes, intertwined with our most private moments. We sat with him, cherishing his presence while also getting ready for his absence.\r</div><div><br></div><div>And yet, when the moment of loss arrived, we were thrust into the world’s expectations of grief—expectations that often felt at odds with the deeply personal sorrow we had already been living. The idea of “grief performativity” helps explain this tension. Rooted in Judith Butler’s broader concept of “performativity,” it suggests that much like gender, grief is often shaped by social scripts rather than purely personal experience. Butler’s work, particularly on gender, argues that traits like masculinity or femininity are not inherent but are enacted based on societal norms. Similarly, grief is not only an internal process but also an external one, dictated by unspoken rules about how loss should be expressed. Just as we perform gender, we are also expected to perform grief—mourning in ways that align with cultural expectations rather than in ways that reflect the true, often invisible, nature of sorrow.\r</div><div><br></div><div>“Grief performativity” is the societal expectation that grief must be displayed in particular, outward ways to be considered legitimate. This can look like adhering to cultural rituals, displaying somberness in demeanor, dressing a certain way, or even changing behaviors and habits. These norms, dictated by religion, culture, and family customs, pressure individuals to display grief in ways that others can understand and validate. For instance, a widow might be expected to abstain from wearing certain colors or avoid celebratory gatherings, while a mourner may be encouraged to cry openly or speak about their loss in public. These visible signs create a way for society to measure grief—whether it’s “enough,” whether it’s appropriate, and, disturbingly, whether it’s even real.\r</div><div><br></div><div>Yet, grief is an internal experience, far removed from what others can see. Psychological theories, such as Elisabeth Kübler-Ross’s five stages of grief, attempt to define this inner journey, highlighting how the process includes denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and, finally, acceptance. But while these stages attempt to make sense of grief’s nonlinear progression, they are still often simplified in the public eye, leading many to expect grieving individuals to move through each stage in predictable, observable ways. Sociologically, grief has also been studied as a collective experience, where cultures shape how grief is processed. However, public mourning and expectations can obscure the deeply personal, often invisible struggles that accompany loss. A person might cry every day privately, but if they don’t wear dull clothes or maintain a downcast expression in public, they may be judged as “unfeeling” or “over” their loss.\r</div><div>The expectation of public mourning, or grief performativity, not only fails to capture the complexities of loss but can distort grief itself. Grieving individuals are often left feeling trapped, as if they must “perform” for others, matching the pain they feel internally with the sorrow that society expects to see. This discrepancy can be especially painful for those whose grief was most intense during the dying process itself. For those who, like myself, watched a loved one suffer and fought beside them through months of pain, grief did not begin at death—it began in those last moments of helplessness, of witnessing suffering with no way to ease it. By the time the person passes, the mourner’s grief may have already transformed into something quieter, more inward, and harder for others to comprehend.\r</div><div><br></div><div>Forcing grief into outward signs makes it almost theatrical, a shared stage for observers to judge and evaluate. Yet grief, when forced to be performative, risks losing its authentic voice. Real grief is often silent, contradictory, and painfully complex. Sometimes, it doesn’t show up as tears or outward sadness at all. Sometimes, it shows up as quiet exhaustion, numbness, or even relief, especially if one’s grief was already lived and processed during a loved one’s suffering. When we expect people to follow a script of visible sorrow, we strip away the individuality and rawness that real grief demands. Instead, we should recognize that grief is as unique as the love that precedes it. It should be allowed to be unseen, to be carried quietly, and most importantly, to belong only to the griever, without the weight of societal judgment.\r</div><div>***\r</div><div>After my father’s death, grief seemed to transform from an intimate experience into something that needed to be publicly displayed, especially for my mother. Suddenly, it was as if her loss had to be marked not only by her emotions but by what she wore, how she looked, and where she was seen. In some way, it felt as if society had handed her a script that defined how she should perform her grief—one that she didn’t choose and certainly didn’t need.\r</div><div>In many cultures, mourning is ritualized, codified, and assigned very particular expressions. In Islamic tradition, for instance, women who lose their husbands are expected to observe “iddat”, a mourning period of four months and ten days. During this time, a widow is expected to stay largely at home, refrain from adornments, and wear subdued clothing. In theory, this is a time for grieving in seclusion, yet the reality often becomes a matter of publicly affirming her status as a woman in mourning. People who come to see her expect her to look and act a certain way, as if her inner sorrow is only as real as her outer conformity. \r</div><div><br></div><div>Similarly, Hindu widowhood carries its own heavy expectations. Widows in traditional communities are often expected to forego bright colors, particularly red, which is associated with marital status and happiness. They are discouraged from wearing jewelry or cosmetics, and they’re subtly reminded that their lives, once defined by companionship, should now be marked by restraint. Though this custom is less strict in modern contexts, its remnants still linger, casting a shadow over how a widow’s life is expected to change. In our case, these unspoken rules surfaced immediately: well-meaning relatives advised my mother to give up colorful clothing, tone down her appearance, and focus on religious rituals. It was implied that her grief wasn’t simply about missing her partner—it also had to be a visual confirmation of her loss, an ongoing statement to the world that she was, and would remain, deeply bereaved.\r</div><div><br></div><div>Even in the West, where mourning is less overtly ritualized, there are still “appropriate” ways to display grief. Black attire, solemn expressions, and refraining from anything that appears joyful are almost universally expected after a loss. The pressure to visibly display sorrow often outweighs the personal reality of grief. A person may still be aching inside but feel compelled to uphold this cultural image of the “mourning figure.” If they don’t, they risk being seen as “insensitive” or, worse, as if they are betraying the memory of the deceased. \r</div><div><br></div><div>In contrast to these rigid expectations, our real grief had already been expressed in the rawest form during the last months of my father’s life. We lived through his pain with him; we watched him struggle and suffer, helpless to alleviate it. That was when our hearts broke. The sorrow we felt then didn’t need costumes or rituals to make it real—it was there in every moment, every sigh, every tear. After he passed, our grief shifted, evolving from a shared endurance of his suffering to a quieter, internalized loss. But society wasn’t ready to let us carry our grief inwardly. It was as if we had left something undone, simply because we weren’t performing it to others’ expectations.\r</div><div><br></div><div>For my mother, this societal script became a kind of prison. How could anyone expect her to adhere to superficial displays after experiencing such profound anguish? Did limiting colors or jewelry change anything about the love she’d lost, the life they’d shared? These expectations felt hollow, inadequate for the depth of what we were feeling. Yet, to avoid judgment, my mother had to perform some of these rituals, even as they clashed with the reality of her inner sorrow. In the end, these conventions seem to miss the point: they attempt to box grief into something that can be seen, measured, and approved. But true grief—the kind that leaves an indelible mark on one’s life—rarely fits into neat, visible boxes. It’s felt, endured, and carried, and no external performance can truly capture its weight.\r</div><div>***\r</div><div>In the months leading up to my father’s death, grief took hold of us in ways I could never have anticipated. There were countless nights spent in silent tears, moments of helplessness watching him suffer, and flashes of guilt at being powerless to ease his pain. This was grief: raw, immediate, relentless. It consumed us well before his passing, as we watched him deteriorate, feeling the weight of loss growing with each moment of his suffering. In those final two months, I experienced a sorrow that I can only describe as a prelude to mourning, a grief so profound that, when he finally passed, I had nothing left to cry. In a sense, he had taken all my tears with him. But society’s expectations hadn’t, and they began to weigh on us both.\r</div><div><br></div><div>For me, finding peace after his death didn’t mean erasing the pain of losing him. Instead, it meant honoring that deeply personal journey that had already unfolded during his last days. The silent, heavy tears I had shed beside him were a testament to the love and sorrow I felt, but they weren’t visible after he passed. I felt almost guilty for not being able to show what everyone expected: that outwardly “appropriate” sorrow. But how could I explain that the truest part of my mourning was already behind me, woven into those final days? The tears I cried then were not about what others saw but about what he and I had shared in his last moments—a grief that was too private, too sacred, to make public. Society wanted a performance, and I had nothing left to give.\r</div><div>My mother’s grief, too, had already taken its shape, but society wasn’t about to let her mourn privately. As his widow, she became subject to unspoken rules, expectations of how a grieving woman should appear and act. Suddenly, her clothing, her behavior, even her social presence was scrutinized. Certain colors were deemed inappropriate; bright clothes and jewelry were whispered about as if they represented a betrayal. There was pressure for her to take up rituals of mourning, to increase her visits to temples, to “prove” her sorrow by embracing a visibly devout lifestyle. But my mother had already lived her grief, privately and painfully, as she watched the man she loved struggle to stay alive. Yet, even as she attempted to process her loss in her way, society seemed determined to coerce her into a more public, ritualized display of mourning.\r</div><div><br></div><div>The expectation that she should perform her grief for others to understand and accept it seemed almost cruel. The reality is that grief cannot—and should not—be staged. There is no single “right way” to express loss, nor any requirement that it should be displayed at all. Grief, in its truest form, exists in the spaces others rarely see: in quiet reflections, in memories that surface uninvited, in private moments of aching remembrance. Grief is not what people witness; it is what we carry. Society’s insistence on visible signs of mourning only adds another burden to the already immense weight of loss, pressuring individuals to conform to customs that may not resonate with their actual experience of sorrow.\r</div><div><br></div><div>In advocating for a non-performative approach to grief, it’s essential to recognize that authentic mourning is both intensely personal and unpredictable. It may involve tears, or it may involve silence. It might look like visiting a temple every day or like sitting alone in one’s room, immersed in memories. It might last a few days, or a lifetime. Grief ebbs and flows in ways that defy a timeline or a checklist of behaviors. And while our society may find comfort in visible, ritualized displays of sorrow, it must come to understand that true grief does not need an audience.\r</div><div>If we, as a society, could learn to respect the personal boundaries of mourning, we would liberate the grieving process itself. We would allow people to remember their loved ones in ways that are meaningful to them, free from the need to meet an audience’s expectations. This liberation from performative grief would enable mourners to reconcile with loss on their own terms, to honor the memories of those they have lost privately and meaningfully, rather than through actions dictated by tradition or social convention. Grief, in this sense, would become less about public performance and more about personal healing—a journey unique to each individual and not a role scripted by society.\r</div><div><br></div><div>Letting go of performative grief would mean embracing the idea that no two people grieve alike, and that sorrow does not need to be validated through outward expression. It is time for society to release its grip on how loss should look and instead support individuals in reclaiming their mourning as a private, internal process. True compassion lies not in observing someone’s grief but in allowing them the space and freedom to grieve in their own way, in their own time. In honoring the private nature of sorrow, we honor the uniqueness of each life and each loss. \r</div><div>Ultimately, grief belongs not to the public but to the one who feels it. It should be treated as a private experience, as varied and unpredictable as the lives we have shared with those we mourn. And maybe, if we can begin to see grief as something personal rather than performative, we will begin to offer each other the comfort and respect that loss truly deserves.\r</div><div>***\r</div><div>Grief, we learned, is not a moment or a ritual; it’s an experience that unfolds in ways only the bereaved truly understand. Watching my father’s final struggle, we faced the rawest pain long before he passed, our hearts breaking as we saw him helpless, a grief few saw but one we felt deeply. After his death, we were expected to “perform” our mourning—to look a certain way, to express a certain sadness that fit societal molds. But grief doesn’t fit molds. It’s not a script to be acted out; it’s a deeply personal journey shaped by each unique bond, each private memory.\r</div><div>As I reflect on this, I urge us all to question these expectations. Grief shouldn’t demand an audience; it’s a personal process, not a public performance. Let us support each other by honoring each person’s right to grieve without judgment, allowing them the freedom to mourn in ways only they understand.\r</div><div><br></div><div>\r</div><div>\r</div><div>\r</div><div>\r</div><div>\r</div><div>\r</div><div>\r</div><div>\r</div><div>\r</div><div>\r</div><div>\r</div><div>\r</div><div>\r</div><div>\r</div><div>\r</div><div>\r</div><div>\r</div><div>\r</div><div>\r</div><div>\r</div><div>\r</div><div>\r</div><div>\r</div><div>\r</div><div>\r</div><div>\r</div><div>\r</div><div>\r</div><div>\r</div><div>\r</div><div>\r</div><div>\r</div><div>\r</div><div>\r</div><div>\r</div><div>\r</div><div>\r</div><div>\r</div><div>\r</div><div>\r</div><div>\r</div><div>\r</div><div>\r</div><div>\r</div><div>\r</div><div>\r</div><div>\r</div><div>\r</div><div>\r</div><div>\r</div><div>\r</div><div>\r</div><div>\r</div><div>\r</div><div>\r</div><div>\r</div><div>\r</div><div>\r</div><div>\r</div><div>\r</div><div>\r</div><div>\r</div><div>\r</div><div>\r</div><div>\r</div><div>\r</div></div>",

    "title": "The Woman Without Kids",
    "body": "I met a woman without kids in a suburban Mumbai play area. She was around the same age as me, swimming somewhere in the shallows of midlife, babysitting her two-year-old niece, a female-bodied individual who chose not to reproduce.<div><br><div></div><div></div><div><i>“These are the longest two hours of my life. I can’t wait to return my niece to my sister,”</i> she gave an exasperated little laugh. \n</div><div><br></div><div><i>“I never fantasized about baby names or who the father would be. Not being a mother feels as essentially a part of me as the birthmark on the nape of my neck,”</i> she said with unapologetic candour. \n</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>“You know exactly what you want,” I remarked, awestruck and amazed.\n</div><div>“I know exactly what I don’t want. I have zero maternal feelings. I don’t see my life revolving around changing diapers, sleepless nights, feeding, cleaning poop and mollycoddling babies. I don’t have the patience to teach a baby to walk and talk and spend the rest of my life asking them to shut up and sit down. The vocation of child-rearing is not for me. Does that make me an anomaly? Well, the notion that a woman is not complete until she procreates is ridiculous to say the least,” she said nonchalantly.\n</div><div>“In a society where motherhood is upheld as every woman’s natural role, choosing to be childfree must not be an easy decision,” I inquired.\n</div><div>“Neither is the decision to be a mother!”\n</div><div>“At the end of the day, we’re all entitled to make our own decisions. I never go around asking mothers why they had children. So why do I get asked why I don’t have them! People think I am selfish for choosing to be childfree.”\n</div><div><br></div><div>In a house filled with books, potted plants and souvenirs from around the world, the woman without kids lived alone, not lonely. Her neighbours and relatives spoke in hushed tones about how&nbsp;</div><div>“she never married” and how “she never had children.”\n</div><div><i>“At 26, people said, “you will change your mind.”\n</i></div><div><i>“At 32, they whispered, “there’s still time.”\n</i></div><div><i>“At 42, they were flabbergasted, as if something was terribly missing in my life.”\n</i></div><div>“Even as a little girl, I cradled books instead of dolls. I never felt the tug, that deep-seated desire to become a mother. I was born to capture life’s beauty differently, through words and pictures.”\n</div><div><br></div><div>The woman without kids built a promising career as a wildlife photographer and a writer. She recently spent a month in Masai Mara exploring wildlife reserves and capturing the stunning kaleidoscope of rugged landscapes.\n</div><div><br></div><div>Her world was also filled with words – the kind that lived longer than people. Immortal words that touched lives. Her heart rejoiced at poems and stories, not the first time a baby cooed and babbled, rolled over, crawled or walked. She wrote notes to herself each night – notes that sometimes read like lullabies. She looked forward to meetings with prospective publishers of novels and photographs, not PTA meetings and playdates.  \n</div><div><br></div><div>“Mothers have memories of their baby’s first steps; I have memories of the first story I’d published. The first intern I’d mentored and photos of some beautiful tourists and locals I’ve met along the way.”\n</div><div><br></div><div>Her life was rich and fulfilled in ways different yet beautiful. \n</div><div><br></div><div>Not all women need to embrace the same narrative. The path to non-motherhood need not be subject to shame and stigma. \n</div><div><br></div><div>“Legacies are not only biological. I shall leave a rich legacy of words and photographs. A treasure trove of musings and meditations, reflections and ruminations, a legacy not of children, but of stories that will outlive them, words that will sustain them. And that legacy will live on.”\n</div><div><br></div><div>“And I am already whole. I don’t need to create a life to have a meaningful one,” she trailed off.\n</div><div><br></div><div>That woman without kids made me reflect deeply. What struck me most profoundly about her was her honesty and clarity. She honoured her choices, unapologetically. She believed in her quiet strength. She stood her ground. Defiantly childfree! And she looked happy. Complete, even. \n</div><div><br></div><div>Womanhood need not be tethered to motherhood. All women do not have to be mothers. It’s a choice, not a compulsion. \n</div><div>People shouldn’t have to explain themselves, but they do it anyway. \n</div><div><br></div><div>I examine my living room: Toys scattered across the floor. A bus with missing wheels. A cracked yoyo. Baa Baa white crochet sheep smudged with red lipstick. A bunny mobile phone without batteries. Lego bricks digging into my bare feet. A puzzle piece floating in my already cold tea. A sparkling new story book ripped to shreds. Walls stained with markers. Half-eaten pancakes. Cracker crumbs. Peeling wallpaper. A frayed couch. Disheveled shelves. And my little one tugging at my kurti, with crumbs of Play-Doh stuck to her diaper. I linger a little longer. I let it all sink in.\n</div><div>I examine my living room: Toys scattered across the floor. A bus with missing wheels. A cracked yoyo. Baa Baa white crochet sheep smudged with red lipstick. A bunny mobile phone without batteries. \n</div><div><br></div><div>In the middle of the night, I find myself scraping rice out of the crevices of my daughter’s highchair.\n</div><div>“Messy yet magical”, I muse to myself. \n</div><div><br></div><div>I feast my eyes on the crayon drawings taped to the refrigerator. Half-exasperated, half-awed, I smile at the picture of a tree that looks like a green lollipop. Every picture tells a story. Our favourite is the horse my daughter drew on a crumpled Origami sheet last summer. Clumsy yet bold strokes of black and blue made it come alive. The horse’s body, a lopsided oval, its eyes – two pink circles – one bigger than the other, the mane of jagged green lines and a tiny tail curling like a question mark. \n</div><div>“Look what I made”, she’d beamed. \n</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;“I love how you used so many colours. I am impressed with your imagination – bold and without boundaries. Makes the picture pop. It is very creative, and I’ve never seen anything like it,” I was effusive in my praise. \n</div><div><br></div><div>As fiercely as I love my daughter, I sometimes miss the woman I used to be. I miss the life I once lived. And I will not shy away from admitting that it is okay to sometimes feel that way. You can love your child deeply and still grieve parts of your former self. I miss the freedom, spontaneity and carefree moments, the lazy mornings, impromptu travel plans, late night walks, coffee dates with my girls, binge watching Netflix, slipping into a pair of skinny jeans, wearing hoop earrings, not having to tie my hair in a bun, indulging in hot food, walking in and out of the house on a whim, stargazing, uninterrupted sleep, but most of all, I miss reading at leisure. \n</div><div><br></div><div>Perambulating merrily from bookstore to bookstore, running my fingers along the covers, tracing the title as though it were a dear friend’s name, breathing in the scent of freshly inked pages that strangely no one ever thought of bottling, the rustle of pages, getting lost and found in the intimate pages of a book, annotating books, the feel of graphite gliding across the page – savouring every moment of the experience, wholeheartedly. \n</div><div><br></div><div>From bookstore aisles to toy store aisles, from bookmarks to crayons, from tote bags to diaper bags, from skinny jeans to elasticated jeans, from The Big Bang Theory to Cocomelon, from Ray Bradbury to Roald Dahl, Ernest Hemingway to Eric Carle, from girlfriend dates to playdates, motherhood has changed my life, bit by bit, nostalgically, magically, tenderly and irreversibly. Once a mother, always a mother!\n</div><div><br></div><div>Missing my old self doesn’t make me any less of a devoted mother. While I do miss the girl I used to be, I can’t help falling in love with the woman I am becoming. \n</div><div><br></div><div>I thought I was here to teach, but she came to show me how to live, how to slow down. In her teeny tiny world, I found my greatest lessons. Every hug, every meltdown, every kiss, every giggle, every sleepless night, every lullaby… a sacred lesson!\n</div><div><br></div><div>What I loved most about my daughter’s artwork was her choice of colours. Like every woman needn’t be a mother, every horse needn’t be a chestnut brown. \n</div><div>It is okay to colour outside the lines. \n</div><div><br></div><div>The next time you’re tempted to ask a childfree woman what happened, why she didn’t, wasn’t she supposed to… Please remember the story about the woman without kids. And don’t forget to smile at my daughter’s black and blue lopsided green maned horse.</div><div>\n</div><div>\n</div><div>\n</div><div>\n</div><div>\n</div><div>\n</div><div>\n</div><div>\n</div><div>\n</div><div>\n</div><div>\n</div><div>\n</div><div>\n</div><div>\n</div><div>\n</div><div>\n</div><div>\n</div><div>\n</div><div>\n</div><div>\n</div><div>\n</div><div>\n</div><div>\n</div><div>\n</div><div>\n</div><div>\n</div><div>\n</div><div>\n</div><div>\n</div><div>\n</div><div>\n</div><div>\n</div><div>\n</div><div>\n</div><div>\n</div><div>\n</div><div>\n</div><div>\n</div><div>\n</div><div>\n</div><div>\n</div><div>\n</div><div>\n</div><div>\n</div><div>\n</div><div>\n</div><div>\n</div><div>\n</div><div>\n</div><div>\n</div><div>\n</div><div>\n</div><div>\n</div><div>\n</div><div>\n</div><div>\n</div><div>\n</div><div>\n</div><div>\n</div><div>\n</div><div>\n</div><div>\n</div><div>\n</div><div>\n</div><div>\n</div><div>\n</div><div>\n</div><div>\n</div><div>\n</div><div>\n</div><div>\n</div></div>",

    "title": "All We Imagine as Light and Girls Will Be Girls: The Good, The Bad and The Ugly Side of Female Relationships",
    "body": "‘Ek aurat hi aurat ki sabse badi dushman hoti hai!’\r<div>\r</div><div>(A woman is a woman’s worst enemy!)\r</div><div>Everyone loves to bring this old adage into the conversation anytime there is even the slightest friction between two women; however, not many are as keen to talk about the different ways in which women are also each other’s biggest sources of support, strength and solace. In a world that is socially constructed and physically designed to be difficult for women to navigate, it is by holding the hand of our female companions and leaning on their shoulders that most of us are able to get through the trials and tribulations of our lives.\r</div><div>When it comes to films, I have always found myself gravitating to stories that depict the experiences of women in with nuance and complexity. But the portrayal of a ‘real’ female friendship on screen, one that is depicted in all its ugliness and glory, is a rare sight to see. Many mainstream Bollywood movies have attempted but failed to capture this very essence in the recent past. Although these films market themselves as ‘feminist’ and ‘female-centric’ and claim to champion female friendship and sisterhood, they often fall into the trap of viewing and presenting women through a lens that is still deeply clouded by patriarchy. Films like Veere Di Wedding, Dhak Dhak, Thank You for Coming, and Crew have strong female protagonists, but these women don’t feel real; they are more caricature than a complex human being.\r</div><div>While I have been disappointed by the portrayal of women in these overhyped films, there have been two recent Indian films that left their mark on me for their subtle yet powerful explorations of female friendship and solidarity. The first is All We Imagine As Light, a 2024 drama film written and directed by Payal Kapadia which revolves around the lives of three different women who work at the same hospital in Mumbai. Prabha (Kani Kusruti) is a young nurse who is patiently waiting for her husband’s return from Germany. Anu (Divya Prabha), another nurse who works and lives with Prabha, is caught in the complications of having a ‘forbidden’ affair with a Muslim man called Shiaz. Parvaty (Chhaya Kadam), an older woman who works as a cook at the same hospital as the other two, is embroiled in a legal battle against a powerful builder who wants to demolish her home to construct a skyscraper. Over the course of the film, the lives of these women overlap, and they forge a strong bond despite their different desires and dissimilar outlooks towards life. The women at the center of the story are ordinary people living ordinary lives, yet somehow, Kapadia tells their stories with such depth and compassion that it lends the viewer finds them extraordinary and magical.\r</div><div>Another film that gets the portrayal of female relationships right is Girls Will Be Girls, a 2024 Indian drama film written and directed by Shuchi Talati. A coming-of-age story that focuses on Mira Kishore (Preeti Panigrahi), a high school student at a boarding school who is goes through the ups and downs that come with being a teenager, the movie is a poignant exploration of girlhood and the camaraderie as well as rivalry that exists between women. While Mira’s feelings, her experiences with puberty and her first encounters are important elements of the film, it is her love-hate relationship with her mother, Anila (Kani Kusruti), that is the beating heart of the story.\r</div><div>While these two films are, technically, very different from each other, set in very different contexts, and feature women of different ages, there is something that they both share (and I am not talking about the actor Kani Kusruti). The invisible string that ties them together is their unblinking and unfiltered focus on the female experience. They show us what it means to be a woman in contemporary India. By making their protagonists ‘unglamorous’ ordinary women, they tell the stories that are often considered not important or exciting enough to be told but stories that most of us who identify as women and have grown up in Indian society will find a resonance in. There were many scenes in both films that had me thinking, “I have felt this way before” and “this experience happened to me too!”\r</div><div>This is not to say that movies like AWIAL and GWBG are not flawless; they too have some stereotypical tropes (the strict boarding school teacher, the gossipy nurses at the hospital and the absent husbands, the oblivious father figure), but for the most part, they feel grounded in reality. The worlds they are set in and the characters that inhabit them feel like places we have been to and people you and I have met at some point in our lives. What these movies do particularly well is to offer commentary on sociocultural issues without preaching about them. It is the small moments, such as a teacher comparing the skirt length of two girls, the little dance party that the women have at Parvaty’s house and the uneasy silences that creep into Mira and Anila’s conversations, that remain in your head long after you have finished watching these movies.\r</div><div>These films feel timeless yet also discuss issues that are very much of their time. They expose the obvious as well as subtle ways in which patriarchal societies try to regulate women, their bodies, clothing, love lives and ways of existing. The cultural anxiety and fear of the woman as a free and sexual being are explored in interesting ways in these films. In AWIAL, the people who work at the hospital judge Anu and question her character because she flirts with the male doctors openly and is known to go out. And in GWBG, the teachers blame the young girls at the school for acting “provocatively” rather than holding the boys accountable for their bad behaviour. These are comments that most women who grow up in India have dealt with and can relate to. However, while these films show how patriarchy can be perpetuated by women in some cases, they also highlight how it is women who stand up and speak up for other women in times of crises. It is Anila who rushes to her daughter’s rescue when the schoolboys are harassing her and it is Parvaty who gives financial and emotional support to Anu when everyone around her treats her with unkindness.\r</div><div>AWIAL and GWBG show the multifaceted nature of female relationships. They challenge the idea of women only being each other’s rivals and “dushmans”, showing how women, despite finding themselves in disagreements and at opposing ends of the spectrum, manage to be each other’s closest friends and confidantes, sisters-in-arms and support systems.\r</div><div><br></div><div>\r</div><div>\r</div><div> \r</div><div>\r</div><div>\r</div><div> \r</div><div>\r</div><div>\r</div><div> \r</div><div>\r</div><div>\r</div><div> \r</div><div>\r</div><div>\r</div><div> \r</div><div>\r</div><div>\r</div><div> \r</div><div>\r</div><div>\r</div><div> \r</div><div>\r</div><div>\r</div><div>\r</div>",

    "body": "Apart from certain dates and the knot of names in Père Lachaise that he had never managed to disentangle, he remembered. Everything was still there. It was three years after the end of the story, F.’s wedding. <br><br><div class=\"image-container my-4\" contenteditable=\"false\"> <img id=\"img-1754119622173\" src=\"http://localhost:3000/uploads/articles/1754119621999-a9aed9e0-be00-4be4-abbc-69928aafa030.jpg\" alt=\"Uploaded image\" class=\"max-w-full h-auto rounded-lg shadow-sm\"> <div class=\"image-info text-xs text-gray-500 mt-1\"> Size: 122.16 KB (31% compressed) • Stored on AWS S3 <br><br>Hearing him tell it, I understood that J.M. had no doubt always hoped to bring this story face to face with a listener, but that he had always feared—when the moment came—that people wouldn’t believe him “if he said everything.” <br><br>And that rather than being troubled by it, he was happy to speak about it. <br><br>It was based on that tape recording that I wrote Le navire Night—twice over, with six months in between. The first version of the text is from February ’78, it appeared in Minuit journal. The second version of the text is what is published here, it is the final text from the film shoot, July ’78. I gave the first version of the text to J.M. He read it. He said that “everything was true but that he recognized nothing.” I asked him if I could publish it and then perhaps, later on, turn it into a film. He told me that he hoped I would. That day we stopped talking about the story. T o tell the truth, never again. After having read what his own experience became—in the words of another—J.M. remained silent but as if he were always on the verge of speaking. I think he must have realized that other versions of his story were possible—that he had silenced them because he didn’t know that they were possible just as they were possible for any story. I think too that his own version had carried him so far that he had forgotten its sprawl, its banality. <br><br>A few days after he read the text, J.M. called me, he told me that he had been consumed again by a desire for F. that was so strong—after reading the written story—that he wanted to know whether she was still alive and he asked me to use her full name, rather than her initials, in Minuit. So that F. would understand that he was calling out to her. I said that the initials seemed sufficient to me given that F. knew her own name. He agreed. <br><br>Later, during the week that followed the film’s release, I called J.M. He told me that he had received phone calls with no one at the other end of the line except for that presence, breathing, undeniable, which he knew was hers. Because that was already her behavior as their story was unfolding, to make sure he knew that she loved him still and so intensely that she might die from it. <br>The dying F. was still alive at the beginning of 1979. I haven’t seen J.M. again since then. <br>I didn’t distribute the text of Le navire Night among those who spoke it in the film. There were only dashes before the sentences to indicate that the speaker should change at this or that moment of the narrative. Similarly, I didn’t specify the order of the shots or describe their content. <br>These precautions, I think I took them to try and erase the traces of the film in order to keep the reader from using it instead of their own interpretation.<br></div></div>",

Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons.\r</div><div><br></div><div>Marguerite Duras’s Le navire Night (The ship named Night) is both a film and a would-be film, or rather a documentary of a film that the writer decided never to finish. Duras abandoned her initial project after several days of shooting, deciding instead to record the “disaster” it became. What results is an eighty-nine-minute composition of slow, panning shots and zoom-outs on the actors that would have starred (Dominique Sanda, Bulle Ogier, and Mathieu Carrière), the makeup and wardrobe they would have worn, and the Parisian backdrops and candlelit rooms in which they would have played their roles, overlaid by the voices of Duras and her friend the film director Benoît Jacquot reading directly from the text she had planned for the actors to use as their script. The original text, written in 1978, describes the paranoia and passion of an erotic affair conducted entirely over the telephone by a young man and woman, insomniacs both, the man working a night shift and the woman dying of leukemia, as they pleasure themselves to each other’s voices and make ill-fated plans to meet in person. Below, translated into English for the first time by Olivia Baes and Emma Ramadan, is Duras’s account of the making and unmaking of Le navire Night, a film which she would elsewhere call “beautiful and vain.”\r</div><div><br></div><div>—Owen Park, editorial assistant</div><div>\r</div><div>\r</div></div>",

    "title": "What if Wes Anderson made a Nazi comedy?",
    "body": "“What if Wes Anderson made a Nazi comedy?” is a reasonable way to pitch “Jojo Rabbit” to someone interested in seeing it. Waititi’s goofy comic sensibility adapts the novel Caging Skies by Christine Leunens into a coming-of-age story that just happens to be set in the fading days of World War II Germany. There is where we meet Jojo (Roman Griffin Davis), a sweet German boy headed off to Nazi camp, where young men learn to throw grenades and young women learn the importance of having Aryan babies (an instructor played by Rebel Wilson brags about having 18 so far). He’s eager to join the Nazi party, tossing out “Heil Hitlers” with confidence when he’s not talking to his imaginary friend, Adolf Hitler himself, played with goofy energy by Waititi in a character not in the entirely-serious book. The writer/director portrays one of the most villainous people in history as a bumbling moron, always offering cigarettes to his 10-year-old buddy and suggesting very bad ideas.<div><br></div><div><br><div><br><div></div><div>Luckily, just around when the ‘Goofy Hitler’ schtick is getting tired, it recedes into the background for the most important plot of “Jojo Rabbit” when Jojo finds a Jew hiding in his attic, played by the wonderful Thomasin McKenzie (“Leave No Trace”). We know that it is Jojo’s mother (Scarlett Johansson), who is also working for the resistance, who has hidden the girl, but Jojo’s incredibly confused. After all, this Jew doesn’t look or act like a monster. He begins talking to her, trying to learn the truth about Jews so he can write a book, and forms a relationship that changes him. The parallel between the imaginary friend who is actually a monster and the girl he’s been told is a monster but is actually a friend is a nice one to unpack, and Waititi is careful not to push the arc’s melodrama too much. McKenzie is delightful and Johansson is sweet and tender—they both add much needed warmth to the film.\r</div><div>“Jojo Rabbit” derails when its premise wears off and you start to wonder what it all means. A kid talks to Hitler and realizes Jews can dance—and there’s some tragedy along the way. That’s it? I kept waiting for “Jojo Rabbit” to become more than a wink-wink, nudge-nudge joke, and when it does try to get emotional in the final act, including a tone-deaf ending for a Nazi character played by Sam Rockwell, Waititi can’t navigate some very tricky tonal waters. Without giving anything away, the final scenes of “Jojo Rabbit” are too easy for a film that needs to be dangerous and daring. A film that starts as audacious becomes relatively generic as it goes along, and even its one shocking turn ends up feeling manipulative. If the premise is risky, the execution is depressingly not so.&nbsp;</div><div>\r</div></div></div>",

    "title": "Uppas Home",
    "body": "Uppa’s home was the definition of what makes a house, home. It was my mother’s house where we as kids spent days and nights together; when being together was the normal and not any luxury to look forward to. The pebbled courtyard was surrounded by trees and a well-maintained garden with a lawn at one end. It was a sight watching the fully bloomed white jamun tree. We used to climb the tree despite the torturous ants. The mango trees were the abode of birds. Most of the trees were homes for us. Homes within a home.\r<div>\r</div><div>On the front wall was a dark blue name plate with Uppa’s name and house name sticking out in white coloured plastic letters. One of my biggest ambitions as a kid was to be tall enough to reach and touch those letters. The front portion of the house had its walls and floor adorned with mosaics of different colours. Plastic chairs were laid on both sides of a teapoy on which Uppa and Umma used to sit and read newspapers and magazines. We often sat on the cool floor and shared stories filled with laughter. Time and again, a gentle breeze would blow, rustling the leaves of the mango trees and at times, scattering the petals of roses in the front yard. A bird had built her nest in this front veranda over the light bulb. Once, she flew inside into the hall and fluttered about Uppa, who was watching TV.\r</div><div>Lying on the mosaiced floor of the hall, I used to marvel at the bright and vibrant colours of the mosaic. It seemed like someone had quite artistically scattered different colours from a palette onto the floor. The hall, however was not the central portion of the house. It was my grandparents’ bedroom around which the whole house had been built. That bedroom with a line of windows opening to the dining hall was dark even on bright sunny days, and we were quite scared to go inside it. But the room was the safest abode on dark, rainy, thunderous nights when lightning struck the ground. We could huddle together inside it and feel safe and warm. It had two beds, a big almirah and a small shelf filled with numerous articles from medicine to money. Umma had kept her Surf Excel container filled with savings inside the shelf.\r</div><div>&nbsp;A long table and chairs occupied almost the entirety of the dining hall. The table was covered with a plastic spread filled with bright pictures of fruits. On the left end of the dining hall was a small room which we called kochu muri. It had a black, cool floor on which my mother and her sisters used to sleep in a “square” when they were kids. Often, someone would stamp the head of the person adjacent to her. It was also the room where they spent their days after delivery. Time after time, a cloth cradle was spotted in the room which smelt of baby products. We all, in a sense, grew in that room.\r</div><div>On the right end of the dining room was the kitchen. The kitchen was predominantly Umma’s space. It always exuded the aromas of either Umma’s curries, payasam, neyyappams or jackfruit jam. Next to the kitchen was a small space which we called koni muri, owing to the presence of a wooden ladder- a koni or eni- that reached the attic. The koni muri had a wooden table with many drawers in which clothes were neatly kept. There was a mirror on top of the table and two small drawers on its sides where we could keep kajal. We used to call the table kannadi mesha (table with a mirror). The reflection on the mirror always looked beautiful due to the lighting in the koni muri. From this room, one could access my grandparents’ bedroom and cross through the hall, dining room and kitchen to reach back in the koni muri again.\r</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>\r</div><div>\r</div><div>\r</div>",

Like serene, quaint and comically brilliant, all at once, in all their glory—something only Wes-Andersonland can make you feel.</div><div>&nbsp; <br>His films are mainstream hits because of the energy he brings to the room. With attention-to-detail architecture and the constant influence of colors, Anderson makes sure his sets become characters too.</div><div>&nbsp; <br>“I have a way of filming things and staging them and designing sets. There were times when I thought I should change my approach, but in fact, this is what I like to do. It’s sort of like my handwriting as a movie director” said BAFTA award winner Anderson, “And somewhere along the way, I think I’ve made the decision: I’m going to write in my own handwriting. That’s just sort of my way”. Well, that's just what we like, Wes.</div><div>&nbsp; <br><b>Soundtracks with Electrifying Energy</b></div><div><b><br></b>Wes induces emotions with his unique pulse and offbeat music that truly set the tone and mood of his films to a great level. His unconventional approach to integrating popular soundtracks into the stories creates a magnetic effect that effortlessly draws you into each scene.</div><div>&nbsp; <br>The French Dispatch's Obituary surely has a big time on the internet but there's even more to this Texas director's selection of soundtracks. From The Heroic Weather in Moonrise Kingdom which encodes a pattern of curiosity to The New Lobby Boy in The Grand Budapest Hotel that marches your attention straight into the film, Anderson's movie albums are filled with an energy that's surely hard to beat.</div><div>&nbsp; <br><b>Thematic elements and hues</b></div><div><b><br></b>The world of Wes Anderson revolves around a constellation of themes rather than just whimsical feelings and subtle idiosyncrasies. Somewhere there is a dent in parenthood, love growing inside forbidden walls, dysfunctional families, innocence, nostalgia, the revival of trust and defining colors to communicate these sentiments.</div><div>&nbsp; <br>Furthermore, Wes Anderson's mastery of geometry, vibrant color palettes, and European-style architecture shines through in his artistic creation, \"The Grand Budapest Hotel\" (with art direction by Adam Stockhausen). This cinematic masterpiece is a visual feast.</div></div>",

Anora \"Ani\" Mikheeva (Mikey Madison)</b></i>, a Brooklyn stripper and sex worker, is in the business of intimacy. Ani’s folly is that she mistakes one for the other when Ivan \"Vanya\" Zakharov (Mark Eydelshteyn), the brat son of a Russian oligarch, sweeps into her life with a whirlwind romance offering a happily ever after. In her world, happy endings are reserved for the buyer. Her days begin late and stretch into the early hours of the next morning in a dimly lit, deafening New York strip club. The opening credits establish the transactional spaces strip clubs are, where her body is spent. Ani is among a series of topless women grinding on the laps of fully clothed men.

When Vanya, the Russian “royalty,” visits, Ani is assigned the task of serving him because she can speak his tongue. The charm of accents and flirtatious conversations in a botched second language is what makes the ‘love story’ in this film. Her rudimentary Russian is as captivating to Vanya as Madison's brash Brooklyn accent is to the viewer. When it collides with the childlike nonchalance, oblivious of consequences, that Vanya epitomises—and which Eydelshteyn brings to the character with ease—sparks fly. \r</div><div><br></div><div>\r</div></div></div>",
